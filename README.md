# RVol Panel (Pine v5)

This is my intraday **Relative Volume** indicator for futures. It tells me if participation is heavy or light **right now** by comparing each bar’s volume to the **same bar index** across recent sessions, and it tracks cumulative RVOL against a typical session. I run it on RTH or ETH charts in TradingView.

**Why I built it:** end-of-day RVOL is late and noisy. I want time-of-day context. 09:35 should be judged against past 09:35s, not 14:20. This keeps my view point on current day intact.

**How I use it (based on the screenshot exmaple):** Around key levels I read participation, not price alone. At the prior-day low, a clean RVOL pop tells me real buyers stepped in; if it’s quiet there, I treat bounces as weak. When price grinds up on low RVOL, I don’t chase—just let it mean-revert or wait. As we push toward the overnight high, I want RVOL expanding into the level; that’s when I consider taking the trade with structure behind it.

**What it’s not:** not a buy/sell signal. It’s participation context. It relies on correct session settings and clean data. News can skew the baseline for a while, which is normal.

**Next plan in my mind:** I’ll mirror code and logic in Python (same logic—session clock, same-bar baselines, barRV/cumRV) to feed real data and expose a small API.
